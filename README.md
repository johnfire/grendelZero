# grendelZero
these programs were created on the Zero pi in the system, which is used as a start up controller for Grendel and to run the IR camera. since its a zero and not very powerful it does not do much else, tho its processor can be used by the system for various short term assignments: the rasp pi 4 b is the main computer once the system is up and running.  note that the Zero can be activated remotely thru VNC connect, and since its the least powerful computer on the system it can run 24/7 at very little cost.
